										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have already made <a href="https://twitter.com/jetbrains/status/1496786254494670851">our position very clear</a> in regard to the invasion of Ukraine. We condemn the attacks of the Russian government, and we stand with the Ukrainian people, including our own colleagues and their families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are announcing that we will be <strong>suspending sales and R&amp;D activities </strong>in Russia indefinitely. Sales in Belarus are also suspended indefinitely. </p>



<p>JetBrains was founded in Prague, Czech Republic, 22 years ago. Over the years we have continued to expand our offices to other countries, setting up R&amp;D centers in St. Petersburg, Boston, Munich, Amsterdam, and other locations. The decision to suspend our operations in Russia has been the most difficult one JetBrains has ever made. It affects us as a company, and more importantly, affects our people. However, we cannot ignore what is happening. It goes against the values that this company has always stood for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of our colleagues from Russia have already moved elsewhere, and we will support them, as we will all our employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are committed to our employees and our customers, and we will continue to build the best developer and team products we can.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>One day you write some code, commit, push, and then receive a comment on the pull request: <em>“Looks good. Oh, but you misspelled this word in a class name&#8221;</em>. Now you have to change the pull request just because of the typo. Annoying and time-consuming, isn&#8217;t it?</strong></p>



<h2 id="how-intellij-idea-spellchecks-code"><strong>How IntelliJ IDEA spellchecks code</strong></h2>



<p>IntelliJ IDEA understands that code constructs like classes and methods should not be spellchecked like regular words.</p>



<p>At the same time, it can split complex CamelCase names and check the spelling of each segment. If you misspell a specific word within a class name, IntelliJ IDEA will underline it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/blog/wp-content/uploads/writerside/idea_grazie.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s what you get with the built-in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spellchecking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spell checker</a>.</p>



<h2 id="advanced-spelling-grammar-and-style-assistance"><strong>Advanced spelling, grammar, and style assistance</strong></h2>



<p>Install the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16136-grazie-professional/docs/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grazie Professional</a> plugin for more advanced checks and suggestions. For example, redundant plurals in code, like <em>entitiesIds</em> instead of <em>entityIds</em>, and much more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Issues</h2>



<h3 id="sub-items-in-issues">Break complex issues down into smaller tasks with sub-items</h3>



<p>You can now add sub-items to Space issues. They allow you to break complex issues down into smaller tasks, or list requirements, DoDs, and other relevant information.</p>



<p>Just like checklists, sub-items can have a nested structure, and you can check them off upon completion.</p>



<p>You’ll find the new <em>Sub-items</em> section under the issue description. To add a sub-item, click <em>Add item</em> and start typing. You can then leave the sub-item as a simple line of text, which can be formatted with Markdown, or you can convert it into an issue and assign it to any team member right away. You can also add an existing issue as a sub-item by clicking on the &#x2733; icon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2400" height="1200" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/break-complex-issues.jpeg" alt="Sub-items in issues" class="wp-image-233318"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/subitems-in-issues.html">Check out this article</a> to learn more about how to use sub-items in issues.</p>



<h3 id="tracking-issue-mentions">Track all mentions from the issue history</h3>



<p>To make sure that you don&#8217;t miss anything important, we’ve made it easier to track any mentions and discussions related to your tasks in Space.</p>



<p>Whenever somebody mentions an issue by its ID or link in a Space chat channel, code review comment, or another issue, the mention is automatically reflected in the issue’s history. This way, you can be sure no important discussions go missing and you always have the full context.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example. A chat message that contains an issue ID is copied to the mentioned issue:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="820" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/track-mentions.png" alt="Tracking issue mentions" class="wp-image-233329"/></figure>



<p>The following rules ensure that private messages don&#8217;t end up being made public. Space will NOT post mentions originating from:</p>



<ul><li>Direct messages</li><li>Conversations</li><li>Private channels</li><li>Projects the owner of the mentioned issue does not have access to</li></ul>



<p>Code review comments from a public project will be posted, but details will be only visible to project members who have access to the project repository.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/comment-on-an-issue.html#issue-mentions">Read this article</a> to learn how to comment on issues.</p>



<h3 id="filtering-issues">Filter issues by board and sprint</h3>



<p>You can now search for issues even faster – use the new <em>Board</em> filter on a project’s issues list to filter by board and sprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/issue-boards.html">Head to this article</a> to learn how to use issue boards.</p>



<h2>Applications</h2>



<h3 id="allowing-space-apps-to-access-private-chat-channels">Allow your Space applications to access private chat channels</h3>



<p>Thanks to the new application authorization options, you can now allow your Space applications to access private channels in Space chats. We’ve also added an option to specify what your application can do within a particular private or public channel. For example, you can allow an application to view and post messages, update channel info, add new members, and more. This level of granularity in the permissions helps you keep your communication private by ensuring that the application can only access the information you allow it to.</p>



<p>To set chat channel permissions, head over to your application’s <strong>Authorization page | In-context Authorization</strong>, select the chat channel where you want to authorize your application, and choose the permissions you want to grant to it. You can also authorize the application from the chat channel by going to <strong>Channel info | Applications</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2400" height="1200" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/applications.jpeg" alt="Allow Space apps to access private chat channels" class="wp-image-233340"/></figure>



<p>Please note that only channel administrators can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/register-app-in-space.html#approve-permissions">grant chat channel permissions</a>. Other users can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/register-app-in-space.html#request-context-permissions">request permissions</a> from the channel administrators.</p>



<p>Currently, applications don’t need authorization to access public chat channels, but we will introduce this requirement in one of the upcoming Space updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/register-app-in-space.html#specify-application-rights">this article</a> to learn how to grant permissions to your application.</p>



<h2>Automation</h2>



<h3 id="support-for-vault-secrets-in-space-automation">Support for Vault secrets in Space Automation</h3>



<p>Space Automation now supports HashiCorp Vault storage, allowing you to use secrets stored in a Vault server in your Automation jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply add a connection to the Vault server, create a parameter, and use it as if it were an ordinary parameter stored in Space.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2777" height="1593" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/vault-secrets.png" alt="Vault secrets in Space Automation" class="wp-image-233362"/></figure>

<h2>Package management</h2>



<h3 id="support-for-remote-repositories">Integrate Space Packages with remote repositories</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re introducing mirroring for Space Packages! With this update, you can now:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Manually publish local packages to a remote repository</strong>. To publish a package to a remote repository, such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/publish-artifacts-to-maven-central.html">Maven Central</a>, you can now specify a list of related remote repositories for each local one and publish packages to any of them.</li><li><strong>Auto-cache packages from a remote repository</strong>. When you reference a package from a mirror repository, Space will download it from the associated remote repository and cache it locally if it&#8217;s not available. This feature allows you to simplify referencing packages from remote repositories and optimize network traffic. You can now use a single Space repository to cache all build dependencies from remote repositories.</li></ul>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/mirror-remote-repositories.html">this article</a> to learn how to use mirror remote repositories step by step.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="support-for-composer-packages">Manage and share Composer packages in Space</h3>



<p>Space Packages now lets you create your own Composer repositories. Use them to store and share packages in your PHP projects.</p>



<p>To create a Composer repository, go to your <strong>Project | Packages</strong>, click on &#8216;New repository&#8217;, and select &#8216;Composer repository&#8217;.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<h3 id="navigation_to_shared_contexts_and_examples_in_rspec">Navigation to shared contexts and examples in RSpec</h3>
<p>You can now navigate from your specs to shared contexts and the shared examples used in them.</p>
<p>To do so, <em>Cmd/Ctrl+click</em> a statement that adds a shared resource: <code>include_context</code>, <code>include_examples</code>, <code>it_behaves_like</code>, or <code>it_should_behave_like</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_tests_shared_context_navigation.png" alt="Navigation to shared context in RSpec" width="670" data-gif-src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_tests_shared_context_navigation.gif"></p>
<h2 id="vcs">VCS</h2>
<h3 id="updated_annotate_with_git_blame">Updated Annotate with Git Blame</h3>
<p>We’ve improved the functionality of <em>Annotate with Git Blame</em> to make investigating introduced changes easier. RubyMine highlights the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/viewing-changes-information.html#comparing_local_changes">differences between the lines</a> in the editor when you hover over an annotation, and you can open the <em>Git Log</em> tool window by clicking on the annotation.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_vcs_annotate_git_blame.png" alt="Updated Annotate with Git Blame" width="670" data-gif-src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_vcs_annotate_git_blame.gif"></p>
<h3 id="git_file_history_new_ui_without_index">Git File History: new UI without index</h3>
<p>The new UI for the <em>Git File History</em> tool window is now independent from the indexing process. The data is represented with a new interface even if the <em>Log </em>index is off.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_vcs_updated_git_history_ui.png" alt="Git File History: new UI without index" width="670"></p>
<p>Previously, for a file with unindexed history, the IDE would display an old history view that was relatively slow and missing features.</p>
<h3 id="updated_commit_details_pane_in_git_tool_window">Updated Commit Details pane in Git tool window</h3>
<p>The <em>Commit Details</em> pane now includes information about GPG signatures and build status. Previously, this data was shown only as a column in the Git log.</p>
<h2 id="user_experience">User Experience</h2>
<h3 id="run_current_file">Run Current File</h3>
<p>We’ve added an option to quickly run a single file without creating a dedicated run configuration.</p>
<p>On the toolbar, select <em>Current File</em> and press the <em>Run</em> or <em>Debug</em> button. RubyMine will run the file currently opened in the editor. Please note that the editor needs to be focused, otherwise the icons will be disabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_ux_run_current_file.png" alt="Run current file action" width="670"></p>
<p>RubyMine will automatically use the run configuration type best suited for this file, the same as it would if you ran a file from its context menu. No temporary run configuration will be created.</p>
<p>For projects which have configured Run Configurations, this new option is available in the dropdown menu on the toolbar.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_ux_run_current_file_dropdown.png" alt="Run current file in a dropdown menu" width="670"></p>
<p>Automatic creation of Run Configurations (for example, when you create a new Rails application) works the same as it did before.</p>
<h3 id="more_actions_in_the_markdown_editor_toolbar">More actions in the Markdown editor toolbar</h3>
<p>We’ve added new options to the floating toolbar that will appear on text selection when you edit Markdown files. Using this toolbar, you can now quickly select header styles and create lists.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_md_toolbar_update.png" alt="Updated Markdown editing toolbar" width="670" data-gif-src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_md_toolbar_update.gif"></p>
<p>You can customize this toolbar with the options you need. To do so, go to <em>Preferences / Settings | Appearance &amp; Behavior | Menus and Toolbars | Markdown Editor Floating Toolbar</em>.</p>
<h3 id="hidden_tab_labels_in_the_debugger">Hidden tab labels in the debugger</h3>
<p>To maximize the usable space in the <em>Debugger</em> tool window, we’ve hidden the tab labels by default.</p>
<p>To make them visible again or to change their location, use the <em>Show Tab Labels</em> option in the <em>Layout Settings</em> or call it via <em>Search Everywhere</em> (<em>⇧⇧</em> / <em>Shift+Shift</em>) with the <em>Debug</em> tool window in focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_debugger_tab_labels.png" alt="Hidden tab labels in Debugger" width="670" data-gif-src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/221_debugger_tab_labels.gif"></p>

<h2>Kubernetes</h2>



<h3>Edit resources on the cluster</h3>



<p>Modifying resources loaded from the cluster can now be done from the editor tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/k8s-edit-resources.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-233194"/></figure>



<h3>Custom path to kubectl</h3>



<p>You can now manually configure a path to kubectl if it is not in the standard location. To set your custom path, go to <em>Settings</em>&nbsp; / <em>Preferences</em> | <em>Build, Execution, Deployment</em> | <em>Kubernetes</em> | <em>Path to kubectl executable</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="621" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/path-kubectl.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233206"/></figure>



<h3>Port forwarding&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We’ve added port forwarding functionality for pods. To forward ports, you can either use the icon on the toolbar or choose the context menu item.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/port-forwarding.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-233217"/></figure>



<h3><em>Describe Resource</em> action in the <em>Services</em> view&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There is a new <em>Describe Resource</em> action present for all resources in the <em>Services</em> view. You can call it from the context menu or use the toolbar button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1270" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/describe-resource-2800x1270.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233228"/></figure>



<h3>Support <em>Events</em> in a cluster</h3>



<p>Cluster events are now displayed in a separate node in the <em>Services</em> view, providing data about recent events in the system.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1120" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/events-2800x1120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233239"/></figure>



<p>To see events for a specific pod, call <em>Describe Resource</em> on it and look for the <em>Events</em> section in the action results.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Werf support</h3>



<p>We’ve introduced limited editor support for werf.yaml and related Helm template files (<a href="https://werf.io" title="https://werf.io">https://werf.io</a>), including code completion functionality, inspections and quick-fix suggestions, refactoring / renaming for .<em>Values.werf.image.*</em>, and validation of some fields like boolean and int.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1400" height="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/werf.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233250"/></figure>



<h2>Docker</h2>



<h3>New Service view UI</h3>



<p>We’ve significantly reworked Docker’s UI in the <em>Services</em> tool window. The makeover has been implemented for containers, images, networks, and volumes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1120" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/docker-new-ui-2800x1120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233261"/></figure>



<h3>Support for Docker Compose targets</h3>



<p>We’ve added support for Docker-compose targets. To add a target, go to <em>Run</em> | <em>Manage targets</em> | <em>Add new target</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1108" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/docker-compose-target-2800x1108.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233272"/></figure>



<h3>Docker Registry V2 support</h3>



<p>We’ve added support for Docker Registry HTTP API V2 to use with Docker 1.6+. You can create simple or password-protected Docker V2 registries and perform all of the usual actions like viewing, pushing, and pulling images.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1198" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/docker-registry-2800x1198.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233283"/></figure>



<h2>Hidden tab labels in the Debug window</h2>



<p>To maximize the usable space in the <em>Debug</em> tool window, we’ve hidden the tab labels by default. To make them visible again or to customize their location, use the <em>Show Tab Labels</em> option in the <em>Layout Settings</em> or call it via <em>Search Everywhere</em> (⇧⇧ on macOS / Shift+Shift on Windows/Linux) with the <em>Debug</em> tool window in focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o8DZ7YmwAyGFMJ7y-HNp1fL3FGZ5rYRipUST7WFl37Bj7i4jzffTA6kQNS-1qji5zThZjwbh9omReX4ZQNUttuL8wLClfJjR5ippl5aYtsWAY-ofDukOfblq1nqyVWN5IfY_Gmg3" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Improved Markdown editor floating toolbar&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To make it easier to format Markdown files, we’ve reworked the floating toolbar that appears on text selection. Besides the new design, the toolbar now offers list creation functionality and a dropdown menu that allows you to select header styles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1scA-4Gyjy24W94HR75Ku0ambD3JS5uclOxs_4fMiRseJlILJnqWsP74O04scCwXNlQVoampbxykUwp2yVQQZThVHgbtG0XoKBBdoJ0t3lJICHYH-6DHzsWCJZNsZBTIpCo3hFWa" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The toolbar is customizable, so you can fill it up with the options you need. To do so, go to <em>Settings</em> / <em>Preferences</em> | <em>Appearance &amp; Behavior</em> | <em>Menus and Toolbars</em> | <em>Markdown Editor Floating Toolbar</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>On-save actions<em> </em>with <em>Save document</em></h2>



<p>When you press ⌘S / Ctrl+S, GoLand triggers <em>Actions on Save </em>(you can find them in <em>Preferences/Settings</em> | <em>Tools</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, starting from v2021.3 the <em>Reformat code</em> option is enabled by default as one of these actions. This means that when you press ⌘S / Ctrl+S, GoLand runs <em>gofmt</em> and the built-in formatter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until now, this would only work if your ⌘S / Ctrl+S shortcut was mapped to the <em>Save All </em>action. It turns out that some users have this shortcut mapped to the <em>Save Document </em>action, and in such cases the actions were not triggering on save.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve addressed this limitation so that <em>Actions on Save</em> now work when you press the ⌘S / Ctrl+S shortcut, no matter which <em>Save</em> action the shortcut is mapped to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fourth build of our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/nextversion/">Early Access Program for PhpStorm 2022.1</a> is now available!</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll take a quick look at the enhanced New Project wizard, support for WebDAV deployment, some additional capabilities for Rsync, and a couple of new inspections.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/">Toolbox App</a> is the easiest way to get the EAP builds and keep your stable and EAP versions up to date. You can also manually download the EAP builds from our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/nextversion/">website</a>.</p>



<span id="more-232868"></span>



<h2>New Composer Project wizard</h2>



<p>We are enhancing the <em>New Project</em> wizard: now, when creating a new empty project, you can choose to automatically generate a <code>composer.json</code> file for it and provide the desired dependencies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ps_create-new-project-composer.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232942" width="800" height="600"/></figure>



<p>After the project is created, PhpStorm will prompt you to install them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ps_create-new-project-composer-install.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232953" width="706" height="394"/></figure>



<h2>WebDAV support</h2>



<p>In this release, we are introducing support for using WebDAV servers for deployment. To configure a new server, go to <em>Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Deployment</em>, add a new server of the <em>WebDAV</em> type, and provide the connection parameters:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ps_webdav-server.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232964" width="900" height="700"/></figure>



<h2>Overriding Rsync command-line parameters</h2>



<p>In PhpStorm 2021.3, we&#8217;ve introduced Rsync for SFTP support to provide significantly faster deployments. The Rsync tool was executed with the&nbsp;<code>-zar</code>&nbsp;command-line options, so that it would compress the transferred data (<code>z</code>), preserve permissions, ownership, and timestamps of transferred files and folders (<code>a</code>), and recurse into subdirectories (<code>r</code>).</p>



<p>In this release, the set of options can be customized: go to <em>Settings / Preferences | Tools | Rsync</em> and provide the required set of options:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ps_settings-rsync.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232975" width="900" height="700"/></figure>



<h2>New inspections</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve added a couple of new inspections aimed to simplify working with regular expressions.</p>



<h3>Redundant modifier</h3>



<p>This new inspection will report the modifiers that are used in regular expression patterns but do not affect the match:</p>



<ul><li><code>/i</code> (case insensitivity) in patterns that contain no letters</li><li><code>/D</code> (<em>PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY</em>) in patterns that contain no dollar sign, or containing the <code>\m</code> (PCRE_MULTILINE) modifier</li><li><code>/s</code> (dot matches line breaks) in patterns that contain no dots</li></ul>



<p>PhpStorm provides the <code>Alt+Enter</code> quick-fix letting you quickly remove these modifiers.</p>

<h2>2021 Retrospective</h2>



<p>First of all, let us admit that we were maybe a little too bold with our plans last year. Space is a huge platform, including more than ten modules that can each be considered as separate products. We wanted to bring in everything from your feedback and our vision, so you can fully adopt Space as an all-in-one solution that covers your entire software development pipeline, but it was just a bit too much to achieve in one year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve partially delivered the features from the 2021 roadmap, and plan to implement others in 2022. Some of the features, however, have transformed into new priorities and will be delivered later. We’ve also introduced brand new functionality, like <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2021/08/05/introducing-subscriptions/">subscriptions management</a>, a universal way to manage notifications in Space, and <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2021/11/29/introducing-remote-development-with-space/">cloud dev environments</a> to spin up and manage JetBrains IDEs backends remotely. We’ll keep enhancing the platform in these directions.</p>



<p>Most of the high priority features from 2021 remain our priority for Q1-Q2 2022:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>On-premises version</strong> </li></ul>



<p>We opened a private Beta program in December 2021. We’re actively collecting feedback and planning to open the public Beta in Q2 2022.</p>



<ul><li><strong>External collaborators</strong> </li></ul>



<p>This is one of the most popular feature requests. We understand that inviting your customers or project stakeholders to collaborate in Space might be crucial for your project. Unfortunately, we had to postpone this feature last year as we didn’t have enough resources. However, we’re actively developing it at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>New hosting regions</strong> </li></ul>



<p>We see a lot of interest in Space from China and other countries from the APAC region. This is one of our Infrastructure team’s main priorities for 2022.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Space Drive/File storage</strong></li></ul>



<p>You’ll be able to upload personal files and all project-related artifacts (images, PDFs, etc.) directly to Space Documents (project and personal). Share, preview, and download files from a single file storage and keep everything you need to work on your project in one place.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Marketplace</strong></li></ul>



<p>While Space is extensible and provides facilities to add the functionality you need in your organization, we currently don’t feel like we’ve provided enough flexibility and extensibility points to the authors of publicly distributed applications on JetBrains Marketplace. However, we’ve made good progress and believe that we&#8217;ll be ready to release Marketplace support in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, you can create applications just for your organization, share feedback with us, and even make them available to other organizations, if you make it multitenant.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Video calls </strong>capability was actively developed through 2021. We made huge progress and opened peer-to-peer calls for the private Beta last year. However, we realize that there is still a lot of work needed. We will continue to actively develop audio and video calls, but we’re not planning to make them publicly available in Q1-Q2.</li></ul>



<h3>Postponed features</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Localization: </strong>we didn’t manage to make a lot of progress on this last year. We have had to make the tough decision to postpone it. We understand that localization is important for many Space users, especially in certain regions, but have decided we need to first concentrate our efforts on making the platform more functional and work on features, performance, quality, and stability.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h1>Roadmap Q1-Q2 2022</h1>



<p>We decided that it is better to divide the work into smaller chunks and limit the roadmap we are sharing to the first half of the year. We’ll be updating our roadmap, carefully listening to and analyzing your feedback, and tuning our own priorities as we progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Our main priorities for 2022 are:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Features (baseline)</li><li>Performance</li><li>Making Space less complicated without compromising the power</li><li>Integrations with YouTrack and TeamCity, and extensibility to support integrations with other vendors.</li></ul>



<p>With this in mind, here is what we’re planning to work on and deliver in Q1-Q2 2022, broken down by Space modules.</p>



<h2>Issues</h2>



<ul><li>Sub-tasks to break down your features and user stories into smaller chunks so you can track progress better and work on several tasks in parallel.<strong> <em>– released</em></strong></li><li>Track all issue mentions from chats in the issue history.<strong><strong> <strong><em>– </em></strong></strong><em>released</em></strong></li><li>Time tracking provides the option to record the time spent on the issues and report it to stakeholders.<strong> </strong></li><li>Swimlanes for better support of Scrum practices.<strong> </strong></li><li>Issue drafts allow creating issues without publishing them immediately and keeping them as drafts for further publishing. <strong> </strong></li><li>Matrix report to create reports based on two issue attributes for a certain period of time. </li></ul>



<h2>Git Hosting</h2>



<ul><li>Multi-line comments allow you to comment on multiple lines of code in the code review.<strong> </strong></li><li>Suggested edits that allow you to make quick edits to the code and post them as suggestions instead of just leaving comments in merge request reviews.<strong> </strong></li><li>Safe Merge allows a user to run automation/TeamCity checks on a specially created merge commit with recent target branch position and merge automatically if the tests are successful. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li>View the diff for a specific file in the code review.<strong> </strong></li><li>Improve the review details layout by making it scalable with clearer quality gate rules.<strong> </strong></li><li>Introduce the notion of &#8220;managed branch&#8221; (MR\PR draft in GitHub, GitLab), which contains code that you&#8217;re not ready to merge yet, but created to track your work. A managed branch can be linked to an issue, and all the commits from this branch will be linked to the issue and can trigger CI/CD. It has a conversation, and you can invite people to work with you on the branch.<strong> </strong></li><li>Introduce merge request descriptions.<strong> </strong></li></ul>



<h2>Automation</h2>



<ul><li>Faster build times in Space Automation.<strong> <strong><em>– </em></strong><em>released</em></strong></li><li>Support for Vault secrets.<em> <strong><em>– </em></strong></em><strong><em>released</em></strong></li><li>Support for external workers (Linux, Windows, macOS), allowing you to run your automation workload on local resources. </li><li>Non-container steps for running scripts on the host machine.<strong> </strong></li><li>Kubernetes workers support for running your automation workload on on-premises Kubernetes. </li><li>File artifacts allowing you to publish and download files, such as archives, rather than just specialized packages in Automation jobs. This should be helpful for mobile development (.apk) and publishing generated reports (zipped xml, json). </li><li>Deployments allowing you to organize the infrastructure around your deployment process. The process itself may happen inside or outside Space. The main idea is to ensure the integrated and automated process of collaboration on and communication about your deployment process. This involves integrating it with Chats and combining notifications from various services into a single stream, supporting integration with Calendars, and integrating it with the VCS. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Re-work Docker support (Docker-compose, Vanilla docker, kaniko).<strong> </strong></li><li>Support more triggering events.<strong> </strong></li><li>Re-work the parameters subsystem (templates in DSL, API). </li></ul>



<h3>Cloud Dev Environments (Remote development orchestration)</h3>



<ul><li>Multiple IDE support: GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, WebStorm, and CLion (starting with the 2021.3 version).<strong> <strong><em>– </em></strong><em>released&nbsp;</em></strong></li><li>Docker support in dev environment containers. <strong><em>– released</em></strong></li><li>Rider support in cloud dev environments. </li><li>The ability to change the IDE version inside a dev environment.<em> </em></li><li>Devfiles support to allow creating a dev environment template as a file in the repository. </li><li>The ability to reload the dev environment after the changes are applied to the dev environment definition files (Dockerfiles, devfiles). </li><li>Support for running dev environments in a customer-managed resource (k8s, virtual machines).<strong> </strong></li></ul>



<h2>Space IDE Plugin</h2>



<ul><li>Space dev environments management in the IDEs.<em> </em></li><li>Enhance the code review integration with the IDEs </li><li>Merge MR/Close Code reviews.<em> </em></li><li>The ability to collapse/expand the comments in diff. </li><li>All-in-one diff with the ability to view multiple files from the code review at once (the same way it’s supported in the Space web version). </li></ul>



<h2>Packages</h2>



<ul><li>Publish packages to the remote repository. <strong><em><strong><em>– </em></strong>released</em></strong></li><li>Publishing artifacts to Maven Central. <strong><em><strong><em>– </em></strong>released</em></strong></li><li>Remote repositories mirroring, allowing you to cache packages in the local Space repository from remote repositories.<strong><em> <strong><em>– </em></strong>released</em></strong></li><li>Support PHP/Composer packages.<strong><em> <strong><em>– </em></strong>released</em></strong></li><li>Support Dart packages<strong>. </strong></li><li>Support file repositories.<strong> </strong></li><li>Support build caches.<strong> </strong></li><li>Fine-grained package repository permissions.<strong> </strong></li><li>Package vulnerability analysis.<strong> </strong></li><li>Mirror container registries.<strong> </strong></li><li>Import packages from an external repository.<strong> </strong></li></ul>



<h2>Extensibility</h2>



<ul><li>Allow Space applications access to private chat channels. <strong><em>– released</em></strong></li><li>Extensible menus and UI customization to connect with the external apps or add more internal linking. For example, you will be able to create an app that allows adding the ‘Create a merge request’ or ‘Create Jira issue’ option to the Issues menu.<strong> </strong></li><li>Customizable webhooks that can support most of the events that happen in Space.<strong> </strong></li><li>Support for iFrames. Add an additional Design section to the Project to show Figma mockups of the project inside Space.<strong> </strong></li><li>Develop, deploy, and publish the source code for the following apps: Slack unfurls, and Slack import.<strong> </strong></li><li>Improve the developer experience:<ul><li>Enable developers to write and distribute (installable, reusable, sharable) apps.<em> </em></li><li>Improve documentation and HTTP API playground).<strong> </strong></li></ul></li><li>Improve the user experience when installing and configuring an app.<strong> </strong></li><li>Sync API to get updates of particular entities in Space (e.g. monitor issues in a project). </li></ul>



<h2>Chats</h2>



<ul><li>Improve chat performance with a more stable layout, faster chat rendering, and less time to fetch data on reconnecting. </li><li>Flexible inline elements in Message Constructor. </li><li>Integrate Authorized Unfurls. An application that is authorized in Google and other content sources that allows you to unfurl private content. Unfurls from Figma, YouTrack, TeamCity, Youtube, and other external tools.<strong><em> </em></strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Documents</h2>



<ul><li>Documents management enhancements: <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><ul><li>Folders instead of the Books.</li><li>Checklists moved to Documents.</li><li>Upload files.</li><li>Centralized management of all your documents both projects and personal.</li></ul></li><li>Documents API to communicate and interact with Documents. </li><li>More granular permissions for documents and folders: view-only permission and options to share documents using a link.<strong> </strong></li><li>Multiple formatting enhancements in rich-text documents.<strong> </strong></li><li>Import documents from external sources.<strong> </strong></li></ul>



<h2>Calendars</h2>



<ul><li>CalDav support will allow you to view and edit your Space calendar from calendars and mail applications that support CalDAV, such as Mac and iPhone Calendars, Thunderbird, and others. </li><li>Synchronization from external (ICS) calendars (Google Calendar, etc.) – this is our main goal in Calendars. We’re actively moving towards it, but not planning to release it in Q1-Q2. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></li></ul>



<h2>Mobile Apps (iOS and Android)</h2>



<ul><li>Chats UX equal to the web version. </li><li>Project tab will include issues list and full screen, documents (preview, share), work with checklists, code reviews assigned to me, recent merge requests, navigate to the native chats with the code review, and project dashboard customization. </li><li>Code snippet improvements (multi-line, diffs). </li><li>Code reviews full support. </li><li>Mobile-oriented UX and polishing. </li></ul>



<h2>Full-Text Search &amp; Go to</h2>



<ul><li>Speed up search by searching for the main entities (profiles, charts, projects) locally, instead of making server calls. </li><li>Redesign search and navigation for specific contexts (Chats, Projects, etc.). <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></li></ul>



<h2>Projects &amp; Dashboards</h2>



<ul><li>Enabling/disabling features on the project level. For example, you can disable Documents or Packages if you’re not using them for your project.<strong> </strong></li><li>Add multiple teams to one project.<strong><em> </em></strong></li><li>Make personal and project dashboards configurable. Provide the ability to add/remove the widgets on a personal level. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Toolbox Integration</strong></p>



<p>By connecting your Space account to Toolbox, your favorite Space projects will be listed in the Toolbox App, which you can easily open in your IDE of choice. </p>

<h2 id="better_next_js_support">Better Next.js support</h2>
<p>In this release, we’ve improved support for the popular <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js framework</a>. Thanks to the out-of-the-box support for React, all of the basic functionalities should have already been working in your Next.js projects. Some of the framework-specific things didn’t work as expected, though. One of them was support for <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages">pages</a>. Starting from v2022.1, this should no longer be a problem. WebStorm will resolve paths used in the <code>href</code> property of your <code>Link</code> components. Code completion, navigation, and refactorings like <em>Rename</em> will work, too.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/next-js-code-completion.png" alt="next-js-code-completion" width="800" /></p>
<p>There are a few more fixes for Next.js planned for the upcoming releases. Stay tuned!</p>
<h2 id="support_for_volta">Support for Volta</h2>
<p>WebStorm 2022.1 will also get proper integration with <a href="https://volta.sh/">Volta</a>, a JavaScript tool manager. It will automatically recognize Yarn and npm installed using Volta.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/volta-support-webstorm.png" alt="volta-support-webstorm" width="800" /></p>
<h2 id="corepack_support_for_yarn_and_pnpm">Corepack support for Yarn and pnpm</h2>
<p>Another thing that made it into this release is Corepack support. Corepack is an experimental Node.js tool that lets you use Yarn and pnpm without having to install them. If you want to give it a try, make sure you run <code>corepack enable</code> in the built-in terminal – the feature isn’t turned on by default. For more information, see the <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/corepack.html">official documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a_new_way_to_run_the_current_file">A new way to run the current file</h2>
<p>WebStorm allows you to run, debug, and test your code, among other things. To do so, it uses the concept of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/run-debug-configuration.html">run configurations</a>. As new users often get confused about this concept, we’ve decided to introduce an easier way to get started with running and debugging your code.</p>
<p>There’s now a new <em>Current File</em> option on the toolbar. With its help, you can run and debug the currently open file using the corresponding button on the right. The IDE will automatically use the run configuration type best suited for this file, the same way it does when you run a file from the context menu. To run the current file, make sure the editor is focused.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/run-current-file-webstorm.png" alt="run-current-file-webstorm" width="800" /></p>
<p>The new option shows up only if there are no existing run configurations in your project. If some do exist, you can still find the <em>Current File</em> option in the dropdown menu with run configurations.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/menu-with-configurations-webstorm.png" alt="menu-with-configurations-webstorm" width="800" /></p>
<p>Please let us know what you think about this new feature. We’re going to refine it further based on your feedback.</p>
<h2 id="other_notable_changes">Other notable changes</h2>
<p>Here are some other notable changes in this build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists with multiple arguments can now be folded in the editor (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-29242">WEB-29242</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve added some initial support for Hermes debugging (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-53699">WEB-53699</a>).</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS completion should now work in FreeMarker templates (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-54820">WEB-54820</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="describe-resource-action-in-the-services-view"><em>Describe Resource</em> action in the Services view&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There is a new <em>Describe Resource</em> action present for all resources in the <em>Services</em> view. You can call it from the context menu or use the toolbar button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SMzjnu5HmSNLnsAoBl-XUKtk356zDalEqwuarrXK8Jm1OgW3dqnh-CUDYwFQ0xXM7_Bm4noxbYMTO2pdEmKOs2qnYmLJrj6hgxRCUJoJ2MafJVpn2SaypEhUlo0yC4JVw9BeAr_o" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="support-events-in-a-cluster">Support<em> Events</em> in a cluster</h3>



<p>Cluster events are now displayed in a separate node in the <em>Services</em> view, providing data about recent events in the system.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PKEVvUPt6HeZalYnS9-LY45WSKdFWpV0aGW5e0gv5m5ujk9wEVJpWXOof3QEjiZbrbVskBhyHOW2dduBm7YgTx0vU1cIGdBEdTdJ3B_YmWjwbkT7PrWkowPqyeD-2bh0vvUENUUQ" alt=""/></figure>

<p>Please note that Kubernetes functionality is available only for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and requires installing a plugin.</p>



<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>



<h3 id="new-service-view-ui">New Service view UI</h3>



<p>For IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1, we’ve significantly reworked Docker’s UI in the <em>Services</em> tool window. The makeover has been implemented for containers, images, networks, and volumes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/W9Xe-68apHUKBMefiphRkizjxbKmCbvKx4e4N8-uSKuYWYnLW7YmLQK6EP5DmGFmGowPZi3yQ3uKMAFb7ZfrmV89LFWqSfpC3NSXiUbu--wj1Iu6wG0nrgFZ8jT5ruyDTaw_z31S" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="support-for-docker-compose-targets">Support for Docker Compose targets</h3>



<p>We’ve added support for Docker-compose targets. For example, to run a Spring Boot application on a compose target, go to the run configuration, create a compose target via <em>Manage targets</em>, and run the application.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2mXc64YkxDre_pcuBVR9eYjdPh1W1YPevlQJFXw3KQCCdfHYmvKOaYh-H56t0_txqb5NFKwHbiBjDkTaxKWkKXiZSY30VMFYteWb-oV2y99O779GPBRY9TZTLVEEWE6zya-hRVpQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="docker-registry-v2-support">Docker Registry V2 support</h3>



<p>We’ve added support for <em>Docker Registry HTTP API V2</em> to use with Docker 1.6+. You can create simple or password-protected Docker V2 registries and perform all of the usual actions like viewing, pushing, and pulling images.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9OQDeVUyr0iXaiSqK0M5ksr6I3ETg3qv1xkYx2BOTxz_l51NVO5h_JrRX5GNAsgN-9TT6r8mwdHA_n9f-lI4e4Bs0gksDjKd07g2HFgIdpBfqstUcgR3wsMarZKk4jkR-j2P0BBN" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="user-experience">User experience</h2>



<h3 id="run-current-file">Run Current File</h3>



<p>To make it easier to run and debug single files without having a dedicated run configuration, we&#8217;ve added a new item to the <em>Run/Debug</em> widget.</p>



<p>If no Run Configurations are configured for the project, the run and debug buttons will now be active and allow you to instantly run the currently opened file. The IDE will automatically use the run configuration type best suited for this file, the same way it does when you run a file from its context menu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NG1PTXDZfkbBcsGgahtL1XvbssOYuHnS8_hjlhQ-lbia7IsE21D9dV-2jfkanqd3g0QV_sdzKn3tuInErxvm7msGqdGv6wOnRxFhcoElcN5aHfOBXxcD-9225hbd3Odv0sOBqAow" alt=""/></figure>



<p>To run the current file, make sure the editor is focused. Otherwise, the icons will be disabled and you’ll get the respective tooltip.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ataFjjVip96UO51YpFp9i9Nre9t_A6ONVovPQCZ_jsVUOyiy5ifQCWC33-WdIfy_1Wyi-54MlmC83orIK8OW-9S3mj8NiN-ydx4zd5EuNw7IE1CY6gANSsgruOcQBORTc5Es1Tbx" alt=""/></figure>



<p>If the project contains Run Configurations, but you want to run only the currently open file, you can still select this option from the combo box on the toolbar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q7r0qxK63rCfecdsIpotIuSabn3VwyBjgRuZSCOSNXPokeawyATflGLa87teU9lNAF9Eq5cDi7vwRcznp7qt495GlZIVF-Cyap4U94egerJDNVkIjJiq2xsT5fafVpG5iAtU5GOZ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When running a file this way, no temporary run configuration will be created. We will soon add an option to quickly modify run options and save a suggested run configuration.</p>



<p>These are the most notable updates delivered in IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1 EAP 4.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings from the Datalore team!</p>



<p>We talk and write a lot about sharing in <a href="https://datalore.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Datalore</a> as we truly believe in the collaborative nature of data workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you get stuck on a piece of code,&nbsp;you can ask for help in real time by sharing your notebook with an Edit access link with your colleagues. When presenting live tutorials, sharing notebooks with a View access link comes handy. And when delivering results, you might want to share the final piece of work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="970" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cover-copy.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232625"/></figure>



<p>Today we are happy to introduce a new feature for the result sharing workflow – publishing of Interactive reports.</p>



<p>Read on to learn how you can create interactive data stories with Datalore.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is an Interactive report in Datalore?</h2>



<p>A report in <a href="http://datalore.jetbrains.com">Datalore</a> is a web page that is accessible by everyone via link. Using reports, you can share your work with everyone, even those without Datalore accounts.</p>



<p>Previously, it was only possible to publish static reports. This is already better for many use cases than sharing a notebook as a PDF or IPYNB file, as you can update the content and your viewers always have access to the latest version of your results.</p>



<p>With new Interactive reports, report viewers can manipulate the controls (dropdowns, sliders, widgets, etc.) and get the results recomputed on demand. Each report viewer will get their own copy of the report and be able to manipulate the controls independently from other team members.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1000" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/play2.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-232694"/><figcaption>Interactive report in Datalore</figcaption></figure>



<p align="center">
    <a class="jb-download-button" href="https://datalore.jetbrains.com/">
       Try in Datalore
    </a>
</p>



<h2>How to publish an Interactive report</h2>



<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add interactivity by using Datalore’s dropdowns, sliders, text inputs, or Ipywidgets!</p>



<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hide unnecessary code by hiding specific cell inputs or outputs.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Hit the share button, choose to publish as an Interactive report, and voila!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2800" height="1800" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-04-at-14.00.51-2800x1800.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232842"/><figcaption>Publish a report in Datalore</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Turn on Reactive mode for your Interactive report to update the report contents when report users change the controls. Without Reactive mode, report users will have to click the Recompute button to update the results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>



<h2>When are Interactive reports useful?</h2>



<ul><li>When you want to bring a more personal experience to your stakeholders while avoiding duplicating your work. For example, you can prepare one sales overview report and each regional sales manager can choose to view data only for their region.</li></ul>



<ul><li>When you are tired of updating reports on a regular basis. Just prepare a query that will take the fresh data, and each report viewer will get updated results right when they need it.</li><li>When you don’t want to set up separate hosting services for your dashboards. Datalore will automatically publish your report via link, so you only need to send the link to your stakeholders.</li></ul>



<h2>FAQ</h2>



<h3>Who can create interactive reports?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Everyone! <a href="http://datalore.jetbrains.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Datalore Professional</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datalore/enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enterprise</a> users can create an unlimited number of Interactive reports and have them run by an unlimited number of concurrent users. Datalore Community users can publish one Interactive report and have up to two simultaneous report runners.</p>

    </a>
</p>



<h3>Do reports consume my computational resources?</h3>



<p>Yes. When a report viewer hits the Recalculate button or changes the control value, a new computation is launched in the backend that consumes the report owner’s computational resources. This computation will also count as a parallel computation for the owner, so Community users’ Interactive reports can be run simultaneously by up to 2 users.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What kernels are reports available for?</h3>



<p>Interactive reports are available for every kernel in Datalore. You can create Interactive reports with Python, Scala, R, and Kotlin and add SQL cells inside each notebook.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Do Interactive reports work with SQL cells and database connections?</h3>



<p>Yes, they do. When the computation is launched, it uses the report owner’s credentials to run the SQL query in the backend. Passwords aren’t exposed and can’t be retrieved.</p>



<p>Last but not least, you can watch this short video tutorial for tips on mastering Datalore and to see the feature in action.</p>
