# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This was an initial prototype to test CDK using Typescript. This module is not in use anymore and it is
kep only for reference purposes. For new development, take a look at `aws-java`.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
